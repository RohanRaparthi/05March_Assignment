    "A glyph is a vectorized graphical shape or marker that is used to represent your data. A Few Categories of Glyphs: Marker: Shapes like circles, diamonds, squares and triangles. Effective for scatter and bubble charts. Line: Single, step and multi-line shapes.You can display images on Bokeh plots using the image() , image_rgba() , and image_url() glyph methods. You can use hovering tooltips with image glyphs to let the user see the values of each pixel.\n"
